            <h1> Are Avocados costly everywhere in the United States? </h1>
            <div class="content">

                <p> <b><u>Production:</u></b> The United States is the second largest producer of avocados after
                    <b>Mexico</b>. About
                    90%
                    of avocado
                    production in the United States takes place in <b>California</b> by more than 5,000 growers. The
                    average
                    grove
                    size in California is about 13 acres. One avocado tree can produce from 200 to 500 avocados
                    per
                    year.
                    About 400 million pounds of avocados are harvested each year in California alone. <b>Florida
                        and Hawaii</b>
                    produce most of the remaining 10% of avocados produced in the United States.

                </p>

                <p> <b> <u>Consumption:</u></b> Avocado consumption in the United States has doubled over the past
                    10 years and
                    is now about four times
                    higher than consumption in the mid-1990s. Avocados have become more abundant in the U.S. due to
                    a
                    large
                    increase in avocado imports. From 2012-2015, U.S. net production accounted for about 20% of U.S.
                    consumption, compared to about 80% of U.S. consumption in the 1990s.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b> <u>Prices:</u></b> Avocado prices have rocketed in recent years by up to 129%, with the average
                    national price of a single Hass avocado reaching $2.10 in 2019, almost doubling in just one year.
                    The <b>resources needed to produce</b> almost 200 million pounds of avocados is the reason for
                    avocados'
                    elevated prices.
                    According to experts, it takes roughly 270 liters of water to grow a pound of avocados. So 200
                    million pounds could require as much as 54 billion liters of water, which means droughts or heat
                    waves can have <b>devastating consequences on the avocado industry</b>.

    <div class="section-1">
        <h1> Exploratory Data Analysis </h1>
        <h3> Why I chose this data: </h3>
        <p> When I moved to the US, a friend once told me about <a
                href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-proven-benefits-of-avocado#TOC_TITLE_HDR_13"> Avocados and
                its health benefits</a>, which I was unaware of
            earlier. I have loved Avocados
            ever since then! I love the creamy and rich texture of this fruit and I innovate dishes using avocados in my
            kitchen; on toasts, salads, and smoothies.
            Recently, I've become so fond of avocados, that I started using avocado lotions, bodywash, and also avocado
            oil for cooking.
            However, I do not indulge in them too often because <b>they are so expensive</b>. </p>
        <p> I lived in California for about 8 months before I moved to Boston, and I realised the <b>differences in cost
                of
                avocados for both organic and conventional</b>
            types in both the places. I was unable to really judge the reasons of the steep prices. <b>Therefore, I have
                decided to study the pattern of Avocado prices in various regions of the United States from 2015 to
                2018.</b>
        </p>
        <h3> The Dataset: </h3>
        <div class="dataset"><img src="Images/dataset.png" width=1000 height=500></div>
        <p> The above dataset on avocado prices is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices">
                here</a>.
            This dataset scans data for National retail volume (units) and price. The Average Price (of avocados) in the
            table reflects <b>a per unit (per avocado) cost</b>, even when multiple
            units (avocados) are sold in bags. It gives us <b>weekly average price and volume for 50 regions &
                cities</b> from
            2015
            to 2018 for two types of avocados –– <b> organic and conventional.</b> </p>
        <h3> How I wanted to clean, parse and refine my data: </h3>
        <p> This dataset has multiple variables and I wanted to visualize my data through a lollipop chart. To be able
            to show avocado prices
            for two types, in the years 2015 and 2018, across 14 regions, I had to flatten my dataset and simplify it in
            order to append the shapes in my SVG.
        </p>

        <p> A simple flowchart below shows how I imagined my data to be simplified: </p>
        <div class="flow-chart"><img src="Images/images_flowchart_edited-04.png" width="750" height="575"> </div>


        <p> The array of the dataset was simplified using Javascript & D3 to this structure: </p>

        <h1> Prices of Conventional and Organic Avocados in 2015 & 2018</h1>
        <p><b>Choosing 16 Regions from the dataset based on Geography: </b></p>
        <p> For this visualization, I chose 4 states from each region - <b>Mid-West, North-East, South and West.</b>
            The strategy was to study the patterns of Avocado prices by grouping them based on regions, since the
            differences in prices is mainly due to its the location. <b>Closer the states are to the cultivation and
                production sites, the cheaper their prices are per unit.</b>

        <p> Below is a <b>Lollipop chart</b> that I constructed using D3 and JS. This shows the <b>average price
                difference</b> between
            avocados sold in 2015 and 2018 for both organic and conventional avocados. The y-axis of the chart shows the
            states in the order of South, North-East, Mid-west, and West from top to below. </p>

    <div class="section-4">
        <h3> Inferences</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> We are able to get a good number of insights from the above lollipop chart. One obvious
                difference
                is between the prices of the organic and the
                conventional avocados: <b>Organic ones in both 2015 and 2018 are much pricy than the conventional
                    ones</b>.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Majority of avocado production take place in Mexico, California and Florida. Therefore, regions
                like <b>Houston(Texas)</b>,
                <b>LasVegas(Nevada)</b>, <b>West Tex New Mexico</b>, and <b>Atlanta(Georgia)</b> have the
                <b>cheapest avocados</b> due to
                their proximity to production sites. SanFrancisco, with its higher cost of living,
                also have cheaper avocados in comparison to those regions on central or north of America.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Region-wise, we see that <b> North-East has the highest avocado prices</b> for both organic and
                conventional types
                because of higher transportation costs from avocado farms in the South. . </li>
            <li> Additionally, all 4 states in the <b>West Coast have extremely lower prices</b>, because of its
                proximity to Mexico, a major production country. </li>


            <br>
            <li> For most of the regions, avocado prices have <b>risen</b> from 2015 to 2018 for conventional type.
                However,
                for organic avocados, prices for majority of the regions have <b> alleviated </b> from 2015 to 2018.
                This might be due to
                the increased production at sites because of improved weather conditions, and perhaps lower demand
                for organic avocados.
            </li>

            <p> Below is a <b>Line Chart</b> made using D3.js with a data-update pattern. Each year shows the
                fluctuations in avocado prices

                to study the pricing patterns because
                I love avocados, and this will make me more conscious about economical avocado shopping in Boston in the
